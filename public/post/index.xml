      <description>Because at heart I am the frugal tight arsed type, when looking for what options were available to start my journey, I did some research that might save you some time.
If you like to learn interactively, Datacamp is hard to go past, particularly if you take advantage of some of the free trial offers you might get signing up for active deals like this one that at the time of writing this gives you 2 months free access if you sign up with your details, plus some other goodies.</description>

      <description>Having decided to improve my capability in this space, I started to research available options. It became clear quite quickly that the choice would come down to Python or R for me, as both of these free and open sourced options had excellent reputations, fitted my budget and had a larged community of active users.
I canâ€™t remember where I saw this tip but for me it was the decider and something worth sharing:</description>

      <description>But, why?Over the last year, I have been fortunate to have time to reflect and refocus on what is important to me personally and professionally, taking learnings away from a career in Retail Management, eCommerce Operations &amp;amp; Fulfilment.
Having had exposure to high level decision making in an eCommerce world inside a large multi brand corporate, it has become increasingly clear to me that handling big data to gain and share insights would be the next business frontier.</description>
