This is the private blog of a Brisbane based Kiwi and amateur R data wrangler. I'm in my early 40's with a couple of great kids and partner, living in the so affordable Brisbane burbs - this is the life and no doubt why there are so many silver fern stickers plastered on VN Commodores around here. Chur bro's.

I blog, therefore I am and hey, it beats watching shitty tv.

The blog is built with R [**blogdown**](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown) and the theme forked from [@jrutheiser/hugo-lithium-theme](https://github.com/jrutheiser/hugo-lithium-theme) modified by [Yihui Xie](https://github.com/yihui/hugo-lithium).

Besides my fancy address that cost $12 for 2 years, the rest of my blog architecture costs $0, making the most of free bandwidth from super quick small [**Netlify**](https://netlify.com) plans. Thanks champs..

Seeing as you bothered looking check out this example of a COVID tracker built with R and Shiny, a great example of interactive and shareable data solutions.
