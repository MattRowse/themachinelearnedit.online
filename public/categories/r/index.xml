      <description>Keeping up with the huge range of R packages released and updates to existing packages can be time consuming and difficult, though important to monitor as there can be innovations that will save you time, if you are aware of them.
One of the recent releases is the i2dash package for interactive visualisations in R. Now how helpful this is for you may depend on your expertise (or not) in developing shiny web applications.</description>

      <description>If you have started your own blog using Blogdown and Hugo, you might be wondering how to monetise your content to cover your operating costs. Sure, it may not be much but every little bit counts right.
Well, today is your lucky day because I wondered this too and decided to write a blog post about it giving you the instructions to add advertising to Blogdown Hugo sites.
So first things first, you will need to go and get an adsense account, which you can do here.</description>

      <title>Shiny, for sharing web based data applications</title>

      <description>After learning R for a few months, the code wasn’t looking quite so much like gibberish and I was becoming more curious about how to share these data insights on a wider scale, other than a static report.
The challenge with the report approach of course is you spend time creating something for a specific scenario and if the business user has a resulting question, they may need to come back to you, with their query/request to view whatever it is they need and suddenly the business user is waiting for you, while you now have another task, to create another report with the specified one off metric and when that’s done, you’ll probably get another request.</description>

      <description>Having decided to improve my capability in this space, I started to research available options. It became clear quite quickly that the choice would come down to Python or R for me, as both of these free and open sourced options had excellent reputations, fitted my budget and had a larged community of active users.
I can’t remember where I saw this tip but for me it was the decider and something worth sharing:</description>
