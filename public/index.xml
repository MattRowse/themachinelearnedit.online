      <description>This is the private blog of a Brisbane based Kiwi and amateur R data wrangler. I&amp;rsquo;m in my early 40&amp;rsquo;s with a couple of great kids and partner, living in the so affordable Brisbane burbs - this is the life and no doubt why there are so many silver fern stickers plastered on VN Commodores around here. Chur bro&amp;rsquo;s.
I blog, therefore I am and hey, it beats watching shitty tv.</description>

      <description>Having decided to improve my capability in this space, I started to research available options. It became clear quite quickly that the choice would come down to Python or R for me, as both of these free and open sourced options had excellent reputations, fitted my budget and had a larged community of active users.
I canâ€™t remember where I saw this tip but for me it was the decider and something worth sharing:</description>

      <description>But, why?Over the last year, I have been fortunate to have time to reflect and refocus on what is important to me personally and professionally, taking learnings away from a career in Retail Management, eCommerce Operations &amp;amp; Fulfilment.
Having had exposure to high level decision making in an eCommerce world inside a large multi brand corporate, it has become increasingly clear to me that handling big data to gain and share insights would be the next business frontier.</description>
