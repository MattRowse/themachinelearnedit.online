      <description>After learning R for a few months, the code wasn’t looking quite so much like gibberish and I was becoming more curious about how to share these data insights on a wider scale, other than a static report.
The challenge with the report approach of course is you spend time creating something for a specific scenario and if the business user has a resulting question, they may need to come back to you, with their query/request to view whatever it is they need and suddenly the business user is waiting for you, while you now have another task, to create another report with the specified one off metric and when that’s done, you’ll probably get another request.</description>
